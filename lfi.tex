\chapter{Latent Factor Interpretation}

In this study, we introduce a method for generating explanations for the
output of matrix factorization systems by means of interpreting latent factors
with shadow models.

The recommender system itself is trained on a MovieLens 20M data set
\cite{data-movielens}, that consists of $<user,movie,rating>$ tuples, where
rating is given as an integer value from 1 to 5, user is given by an anonymous
ID, and movie is given by an ID that is uniquely associated with the movie
title.

The metadata for the movies is assembled from multiple sources. MovieLens data
set itself contains data about movie genres and user-generated unstructured
tags. Then we incorporated the IMDB data set\cite{data-imdb}, that contains
information about user-generated movie keywords, directors, producers,
composers, and other data. Finally, we incorporated DBTropes\cite{data-dbtropes}
-- a machine-readable version of TV Tropes -- a wiki-based website that contains
descriptions of movies and other media in terms of commonly appearing patterns,
which they call ``tropes''. We have also tried incorporating more unstructured
user-generated data and using topic modeling to transform it into
machine-readable features, but this method has not increased the quality of
prediction and explanation substantially enough to be used.
